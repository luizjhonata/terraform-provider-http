# http Provider





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `url` (String) The base URL for all HTTP requests made by this provider. This URL serves as the root endpoint for the Web endpoint that the provider will interact with. It is a required attribute and must be specified to ensure proper communication with the target.

### Optional

- `basic_auth` (Attributes) Credentials for basic authentication. This attribute allows you to specify the username and password required for basic HTTP authentication. It is optional and should be used when the target Web endpoint requires basic authentication for access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--basic_auth))
- `ignore_tls` (Boolean) A boolean flag to indicate whether TLS certificate verification should be ignored. This is useful for testing purposes or when interacting with APIs that use self-signed certificates. It is optional and defaults to `false`.

### Nested Schema for `basic_auth`

Required:

- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for basic authentication. This is a required field within the `basic_auth` block and must be provided if basic authentication is used. The password is marked as sensitive to ensure it is not exposed in logs or state files.
- `username` (String) The username for basic authentication. This is a required field within the `basic_auth` block and must be provided if basic authentication is used.

# http_request (Resource)

Simple configuration to tell Terraform that HTTP provider is not the official one.

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       http = {
         source = "rios0rios0/http"
         version = "1.0.0"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

After that, you can use the `http_request` resource to make HTTP requests.

   ```hcl
   resource "http_request" "example1" {
     method  = "GET"
     path     = "/posts/1"
     headers = {
       "Content-Type" = "application/json"
     }
   }

   resource "http_request" "example2" {
     method  = "GET"
     path     = "/posts/2"
     headers = {
       "Content-Type" = "application/json"
     }
     request_body = jsonencode({
       test = lookup(jsondecode(http_request.example1.response_body_json), "id", "")
     })
   }
   ```

You have access to the response body and response code.

   ```hcl
   output "response_code" {
     value = http_request.example.response_code
   }
  
   output "response_body" {
     value = http_request.example.response_body
   }
   ```
